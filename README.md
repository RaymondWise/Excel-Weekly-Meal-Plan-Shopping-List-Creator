# Excel-Weekly-Meal-Plan-Shopping-List-Creator

This is a spreadsheet that contains a template for creating a weekly meal plan. Within the template, you can enter meals and food that you'd like to have on the menu.

Within the other tabs exists the food as you've defined it - your recipe, your ingredients. 

When you click the shopping list button, it finds each item on your meal plan and gathers the ingredients, removes the duplicates, and prints a shopping list.
